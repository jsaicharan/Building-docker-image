#Used VS code to build run and push the image

#First we create the python program file named main.py
#Similarly created Dockerfile, sai.txt(read by program to count the repeated words)

#The commands for docker will be;

docker pull python        #We first pull the base image
docker build -t my-counter .      #We build a new image named "my-counter"

#We can check the images by giving command
docker images

docker run -dit my-counter        #We run the image 
docker commit a96b230c08c5 saicharanj/myapp:new       #a96b230c08c5 is the ID of Image my-counter
docker push saicharanj/myapp:new        #We push the image to docker public repository

#To pull this image use the command
docker pull saicharanj/myapp:new        #new is the tag given
